Abstract: 

This is the Ca4 project of mobile App in Android studio, for this module we were required to create or build a Shopping App in Android studio where users will be allowed to make purchase, and buy they product, keeping their order history and browser thought this App. The App requirements were done by the lecture of this module and all students should be able to build it following the instructions given on Moodle.   

Introduction: 

To start this section, I would like to bring up this point about: Why did we were required to build this App in android studio?                                                               So, to answer this question, I can start explaining the purpose of this project, and you may get it better. This is a project which involves a lot of research for the developers, pushing them to learn more about this subject. All experiments carried out in this project were a challenge and proof for all students of this module to put what they have learned so far, and to keep them more and more focused and to be prepared for the next steps for their career. 

Procedures: 

To this next section, I would like to talk more about the procedures that I have taken to develop and build this application, of course to build the structure of Ann project like this as I said before it will involve too much research to reach our goals, and in this application was not different. When I started creating this project, I counted a lot of information, and I could find some helpful tutorials on the internet such as in: YouTube and stackoverflow. I decided to start by creating my recycler shopping view and then my cart view, and then I could find some information to start creating my login page. 

Results: 

When we create our project, we are expecting as many best results as possible, and then like this we can feel like the project was a good one, in my case it was not different, as I mentioned previously, I could find a lot of information and use everything that I learned to achieve my results, but of course I got some unexcepted events as well which I couldn't get through.  

Discussion: 

For this section I would like to talk about things that went wrong in my projects, and what things that I could not accomplish in it. As this is a difficult project and the last one for this module this semester, we needed to use everything that we have learned so far, but some issues in android studio that didnâ€™t work very well in my project made me unable to accomplish some tasks such as: Use Json properly and use URL images to load in android, despites all things and challenges that I get in trouble, I could create my recycler view successfully. 

Conclusion: 

This was the last project for this module Ca4 mobile App, where I used this report to share my experience and try to bring up some important point in my point of view and try to get my point across as clearly as possible. All notes on this report are a complement to what about I have done in my android studio project, and beside this report you can find my project on GitHub, and I left the link for the video about this project as well above of this report, where you will check everything, every steps that I have taken to develop it.
